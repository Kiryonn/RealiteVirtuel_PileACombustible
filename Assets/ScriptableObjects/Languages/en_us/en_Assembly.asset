  StackInstructions: The first item we are going to place is the <stack>, wich is
    mailny made up of membranes. These membranes will produce <electricity> from
    oxygen and hydrogen. Place the <stack> on the location of the floating gray cube.
  DihydrogenInstructions: We are now going to deal with the <hydrogen> circuit. It
    is one of the reactants necessary for the electrochemical reaction to take place
    within the <stack>. The <hydrogen> circuit is already positioned. Connect the
    <hydrogen_bottle> to the end of the circuit.
  AirCompressorInstructions: After connecting the <hydrogen>, we will connect the
    <oxygen>. <oxygen> is the other reagent required for the generation of <electricity>.
    In our case, we will use the <oxygen> contained in the <air>. An Air filter is
    already positioned, it's up to you to put the <compressor>.
  HumidifierInstructions: 'The membranes which make up the <stack> are fragile components.
    To protect them, it is important to add <humidity> to the <air> entering the
    <stack>.

    Therefore you have to place a <humidifier> between the <compressor>
    and the <stack>.'
  NitrogenInstructions: 'To stop the <pemfc> when it is running, we put <nitrogen>
    instead of <hydrogen> into the system. This stops the reaction that takes place
    within the <stack>.

    Place the <nitrogen_bottle>.'
  FanInstructions: "You may have noticed, but you've already placed most components.\nIf
    there is a leak of <hydrogen> in this space, the gas will accumulate, and potentially
    cause an explosion. To avoid this accumulation, put a <fan> on the <pemfc>'s
    top.\r"
  WaterInstructions: "The <pemfc> produces <electricity>, but also <water>. This
    water must be evacuated, so we will collect it in a <water_container>. \r\nPlace
    the <water_container> at the right place."
  RadiatorInstructions: "The electrochemical reaction that takes place within the
    <stack> generates <heat> in addition to <electricity> and <water>.\r\nIn order
    for the reaction to be as efficient as possible, it must take place at a certain
    temperature.\r\nIn order to maintain this temperature, the <stack> is connected
    to a cooling system.\r\nPlace the <radiator>.\r"
